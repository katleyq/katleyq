## Hello, hello! 👋
My name is Kat Le (they/she). I'm an environmental data scientist with years of training in research and education information technology. I earned my Master of Environmental Data Science degree at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My primary focus is solving complex environmental problems by leveraging data science, and I’m passionate about mentoring others to grow their skills and make an impact in this space.


### About Me
My areas of expertise are:
- 🌎📊 **Environmental Data Science**: Through data-driven advocacy, I aim to amplify the stories and experiences of communities most affected by environmental challenges, ensuring their voices shape climate action and environmental policy. My focus is in environmental justice and equitable access to clean water and energy.
- 💻 🔧**Research and Education IT**: From spinning up high-performance computing environments to teaching users how to leverage new tools, I build out and teach the technical infrastructure that enables environmental research and education. My work empowers researchers and students to focus on learning and discovery rather than technical obstacles.
- 🌱💡**Mentorship**: My mentors throughout the years taught me more than just technical skills - they showed me how to embrace challenges and grow through them. My mission in every stage of my career has been to pay it forward to the newest generation of environmental scientists with the same transformative mentorship that shaped my success.
  
In my free time, I like to play basketball 🏀, craft 🎨, and cook 🧑‍🍳 with friends.
